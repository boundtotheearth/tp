--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command Format
Below is an explanation of the formatting used to show commands:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Items with `…` inside square brackets `[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can take in multiple space separated arguments
  e.g. `[[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can represent `t/friend friend family` 
* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
* `type/alpha` and `order/asc` will be used as default if both sort type and order are not specified (i.e. command is `sort`)
* Current sort type will be used if the `type` is not specified but `order` is specified.
* `order/asc` will be used as default if the `order` is not specified but `type` is specified.
* For `sort type/deadline`, projects without deadlines will be ordered alphabetically after the ordered list of projects with deadlines.
* For both `sort type/deadline` and `sort type/created`, projects with same deadline or same created date will be sorted alphabetically.
</div>

Example:

The following are 3 projects in the project book.

Project 1. Name: `Ant Hole`, Deadline: `2020-02-02`, Created Date: `2000-02-02`
Project 2. Name: `Brunch`, Deadline: `2010-01-01`, Created Date: `2002-09-09`

**3.6.2.3 Sorting by Default order**

Format: `sort`

* Sorts projects in alphabetical, ascending order

Result: [Project 1, Project 2, Project 3]

##### Sorting With Only Type Specified 

Format: `sort type/SORT_TYPE`

* Sorts projects in a specified order
* Since order is not specified, default order is ascending

Example: `sort type/alpha`
Result: [Project 1, Project 2, Project 3]

Example: `sort type/deadline`
Result: [Project 2, Project 1, Project 3]

Example: `sort type/created`
Result: [Project 1, Project 3, Project 2]

#### Sorting With Only Order Specified 

Format: `sort order/SORT_ORDER`

* Sorts projects in current project order.
* If there is no existing project order (when the application restarts), order will be alphabetical by default.

Example: `sort order/dsc` (After application restarts for the first time)
Result: [Project 3, Project 2, Project 1]

Example `sort order/asc` (Current sort type is Deadline)
Result: [Project 2, Project 1, Project 3]

#### Sorting With Both Type and Order Specified

* Sorts projects in specified type and order.
* Projects that cannot be ordered in a certain type will be ordered alphabetically.

Example: `sort type/alpha order/dsc`
Result: [Project 3, Project 2, Project 1]

Example: `sort type/deadline order/asc`
Result: [Project 2, Project 1, Project 3]

Example: `sort type/created order/dsc`
Result: [Project 2, Project 3, Project 1]

#### Filtering Projects: `find`

Searches for projects or tasks in the project book based on certain parameters.

Format: `find [match/FILTER_TYPE] [n/NAME [MORE_NAMES]...] [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...] [c/COMPLETION_STATUS]`

* There are two values for the `match` command.
* `match/all` requires **all** parameters to match their respective entries in the project for it to be shown.
* `match/any` shows the project as long as any parameter matches the user's input.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
You can only search for projects in the project view and tasks in the tasks view
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
`match/any` will be used if the `match` type is not specified.
</div>

Example:

If there are 3 projects in the project book:

1. Name: `Create Logo` , Description: `Make logo for startup XYZ`, Tags: `Design`
2. Name: `Write Song`, Description: `80s rock music, three minutes`, Tags: `Music`
3. Name: `Write Article`, Description: `Write and article about why Momentum is the best app out there`, Tags: `Press` and `Writing`

* `find match/any n/song article d/startup t/design` will return all three projects. This is because project 1 contains the keyword `startup` in its description and the tag `design`, project 2 contains the keyword `song` in its name and project 3 contains the keyword `article` in its name. 
* `find match/all n/song article d/startup t/design` will not return any project as there is no project with `song` **and** `article` in its name **and** the `startup` in its description and the tag `design`.
* `find match/any n/write d/rock` will return projects 2 and 3. This is because project 2 contains `write` in its name and `rock` in its description. Project 3 also contains the word `write` in its name.
* `find match/all n/write d/rock` will only return project 2. This is because project 2 is the only project that contains both `write` in its name and `rock` in its description. 

##### Searching by name: 
* The `n/` command checks whether a project has a certain name. There can be multiple names added to this command. For example, `n/car window` will check for the projects that contain `car` or `window` in their names.
* Searching by name only requires a partial match. This means that a project with the name `carpet` and `car` can potentially be the result of searching for the term `car`.

##### Searching by description: 
* The `d/` command checks whether a project has a certain description. There can be multiple descriptions added to this command. For example, `d/sunday october` will check for the projects that contain `sunday` or `october` in their description.
* Searching by description only requires a partial match, similar to searching by name.

##### Searching by tag: 
* The `t/` command checks whether a project has a certain tag. There can be multiple tags added to this command. For example, `t/freelance errands` will check for the projects that contain the tags `freelance` or `errands`.
* Searching by tags will require a full word match unlike searching by name or description. This means that searching for the tag `free` will not find a project with the tag `freelance`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
Searches for tags require a full match whilst searches partial matches are sufficient for searches by name and description.
</div>

#### Searching by Completion Status

* There are keywords, completed and incomplete for`c/KEYWORD`. Other keywords are not accepted.
* The `c/` command checks whether a project is completed. For example, `t/completed` will check for the projects that are completed.
* When `c/` is not specified, both complete and incomplete projects will be shown.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
If a certain search type is used more than once, the latest entry will be used.
`find n/a n/b n/c` will only search for projets/task that contain`c` in their name.
</div>

## Time Tracking
You can track the time you spend working on a project by starting a timer when you start working, and then stopping the timer once you finish.

Momentum remembers each timer that you start/stop and uses this information to calculate statistics.

### Starting a Timer for a Project: `start`

Format: `/start PROJECT_ID`

* Starts a timer for the project at the specified `PROJECT_ID`.
* Only 1 timer can be running for a project at any time.
* The id refers to the id number shown in the displayed project list.
* The id **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
You can run timers for more than one project concurrently, if you are multi-tasking.
</div>

Example: `/start 2`

Result: Starts a timer for the second project in the list.

### Stopping a Timer for a Project: `stop`

Format: `/stop PROJECT_ID`

* Stops a running timer for the project at the specified `PROJECT_ID`.
* A timer can only be stopped if there is one already running.
* The id refers to the id number shown in the displayed project list.
* The id **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Example: `/stop 2`

Result: Stops the timer for the second project in the list.

## Undo/Redo
Undo command undoes previous commmand and redo command redoes previously undone command.

### Undoing the Previous Command: `undo`
The undo command resets the application to the state before previous command was executed.

Format: `/undo`

Example: `start 1`, `undo`

Result: Timer for project/task at index 1 is started, then stopped and removed after undo is executed.


### Redoing the Previous Command: `redo`
The redo command redoes previously undone command and resets the application to the state before the previous undo command.

Format: `/redo`

Example: `sort type/deadline`, `undo`, `redo`

Result: Projects are sorted by deadline, then the application is reset to the sorting order before sort command was executed, then reset back to sort by deadline after redo command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:**
* Undo/redo feature keeps track of changes in state, and hence will not work on `help` command which does not change the state of the application.
* Redo command only works if there the previous command is `undo`.
</div>

## Statistics
Statistics are automatically generated and updated whenever projects are 
added/deleted/changed, and when timers are started/stopped. They can be seen in the bottom left of the window. You do not need to use any additional commands to update or view statistics.

Here are the statistics being tracked by Momentum:
### Time Spent Per Project
This statistic tells you the total amount of time you have spent within a timeframe. By default, the timeframe will be set to weekly. You can change the timeframe through the [settings](#settings).

## Settings
You can adjust various settings in Momentum, which for now includes:
* GUI Theme
* Statistic Timeframe

Format: `set [th/THEME] [st/TIMEFRAME]`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* There are two GUI themes available, light and dark. The commands to apply them are:
    * `th/light`
    * `th/dark`
* There are three available timeframes for statistics, daily, weekly and monthly. The commands to apply them are:
    * `st/daily`
    * `st/weekly`
    * `st/monthly`

Example: `set th/dark st/daily`
Result: Sets a dark theme to the GUI and changes the statistics pane to show the time spent on projects within the day.


## Clear All Projects/Tasks : `clear`
Removes all projects and tasks in Momentum.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:warning: **Warning**
This will remove **everything** in Momentum, including all saved data.
</div>

Format: `clear`

## Show and Hide SideBar Components : `show`
You can hide or show compoenents in the sidebar.

The sidebar has four components:

* Reminder
* Tags
* Timers
* Time Spent

Currently, only the Reminder component is supported.

Format: `show [r/]`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* `r/` would dismiss the reminder by hiding the reminder component.

Example: `show r/`
Result: Hides the Reminder component of the sidebar.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:warning: **Warning**
A reminder that has been dismissed cannot be shown again.
</div>

## Exiting the Program : `exit`
All project, task and timer data are saved automatically after every command. There is no need to save manually.

You can find the saved data in the following file in the same location where Momentum is located: `data/projectbook.json`

Format: `exit`

Result: Exits the program.
