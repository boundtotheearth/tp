## 1. Introduction

Attention all freelancers, here is an application you have always wanted, but never got to experience!

We freelancers are always busy managing multiple projects at once. On top of that, each project comes with its own tasks and deadlines. This list is endless, but sadly, our brain capacity is exhausive.

As freelancers ourselves, we understand. We too have had times where we woke up feeling fresh, before realising (with a shiver down our spine) that we have completely forgotten about a certain project deadline. 

This is why we have developed an application for freelancers, and freelancers only. 

Leave it to Momentum to do the following for you:
* **Organisation of Projects**
    * View projects’  sub-tasks, deadline, description with just a few keystrokes.
    * Find any projects and task in Momentum with a single command.
    * Sort projects in different orders to your convenience at any time.
* **Project Management**
    * Set reminders to remind you of upcoming deadlines.
* **Time Management**
    * Keep track of how much time you have been spending on each project using our time-tracking tools.
    * Gain insights into your time usage with our statistics feature.
* **Personalisation**
    * Personalise Momentum’s settings to fit your preference.

We present you Momentum, the application that will make sure you never lose your momentum in your work ever again.

Momentum is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application equipped with Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is interactive, visually appealing, and easy to use. This means everything within our application can be done with just your keyboard, which provides a user-friendly experience for you. 

## 2. About this Document
This user guide provides detailed explanations and walkthroughs on the features available in Momentum. If you wish to learn how to use Momentum, this guide is for you. While reading this document, here are a few things you should take note of.

### 2.1. Notations Used
Throughout this document, you will come across these notations:

* **Clickable Links**: Words or phrases that are blue in colour are links which you can click on that will take you over to the section or page as described. For example, clicking on [this](#introduction) will take you back to the introduction of the user guide. 

* **Info Boxes**: These will display additional information that is good for you to know. There are two types of boxes, tip and warning boxes, and they are showed below:

  <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
  
  :bulb: These are tip boxes. They will provide you with useful tips.

  </div>

  <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
  
  :warning: These are warning boxes. They will contain information of things that you should be careful of.

  </div>

* **Keyboard Keys**: Words that are wrapped in a box like <kbd>this</kbd> points to a corresponding key on your keyboard.

* **Terminology**: Momentum tracks both projects and tasks. In this document, we will refer to both projects and tasks as items. 


### 2.2. Command Format

You will be presented with multiple commands throughout this document. You may find the description of the command format below.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. Parameters are preceded by prefixes. The prefixes represent what the parameters will be used for in the command.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Blog Design`, whereas the `n/` signifies that the parameter is being used in the name.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Blog Design t/friend` or as `n/Blog Design`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items with `…` inside square brackets `[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can take in multiple space separated arguments
  e.g. `[[t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...]` can represent `t/friend friend family`.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. If the command specifies `n/Blog Design dd/2020-11-05`, `dd/2020-11-05 n/Blog Design` is also acceptable.


#### 2.2.1. Index Format

* You need to enter an id which refers to the id number shown in the displayed list.

  * `order/asc` will sort the list of items in ascending order.

  * `order/dsc` will sort the list of items in descending order.

In addition to the above sort types and orders, the list can be sorted by completion status.

* This is the "dominant sort" that will ensure that all incomplete items are above complete items, before sorting the items in the specified sort type and order above.

* The default sort order will sort the items by completion status.

* `sort c/` will toggle the default completion status sort.

    * Once the completion status sort is off, the items will be sorted in the specified sort type and order without regard for their completion status.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: Here are some things you should take note of.

* When the application first starts, the completion status order is turned on. This completion status sort status (on/off) is maintained until it is toggled.

* `type/alpha` and `order/asc` will be used as default if both sort type and order are not specified. For example, when the command is `sort`.

* For both `sort type/deadline` and `sort type/created`, items with the same deadline or same created date will be sorted in alphabetical order.

* For `sort type/deadline`, items with deadlines will appear at the top of the list sorted in deadline order, while those without deadlines will be pushed to the end of the list sorted in alphabetical order.

</div>

    ![Created Descending 3](images/CreatedDescending3.png)

    Note that for projects with the same created date, they are sorted in descending alphabetical order.

#### 5.1.7. Searching for Items: `find`

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

Momentum allows you to make detailed searches for items based on a combination of their name, description, tags and completion status. This is done using the find command.

Format: `find [match/FILTER_TYPE] [n/NAME [MORE_NAMES]...] [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...] [c/COMPLETION_STATUS]`

Here are some ways you can make simple searches using the find command. Advanced searches will be [discussed later](#searching-by-multiple-parameters). 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: You can only search for projects in the project view and tasks in the tasks view.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: Search parameters are not case sensitive.

</div>

##### 5.1.7a. Searching by Name

* The `n/` prefix checks whether an item has a certain name.

* Searching by name only requires a partial match. This means that an item with the name `carpet` and `car` can potentially be the result of searching for the term `car`.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for items with `ad` in their name.

1. Key in the command `find n/ad` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Name Step 1](images/FindByName1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Name Step 2](images/FindByName2.png)

3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name will be shown.

    ![Find by Name Step 3](images/FindByName3.png)

##### 5.1.7b. Searching by Description

* The `d/` prefix checks whether an item has a certain description.

* Searching by description only requires a partial match, similar to searching by name.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for items with `discussion` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find d/discussion` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Description Step 1](images/FindByDesc1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Description Step 2](images/FindByDesc2.png)

3. All projects that contain `discussion` in their description will be shown.

    ![Find by Description Step 3](images/FindByDesc3.png)

##### 5.1.7c. Searching by Tag

* The `t/` prefix checks whether an item has a certain tag.

* Searching by tags will require a full word match unlike searching by name or description. This means that searching for the tag `free` will not find an item with the tag `freelance`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: Searches for tags require a full match whilst partial matches are sufficient for searches by name and description.

</div>

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects with the tag `webdesign`.

1. Key in the command `find t/webdesign` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Tag Step 1](images/FindByTag1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Tag Step 2](images/FindByTag2.png)

3. All projects that contain the tag `webdesign` will be shown.

    ![Find by Tag Step 3](images/FindByTag3.png)

##### 5.1.7d. Searching by Completion Status

* Only the parameters `completed` and `incomplete` are accepted for `c/KEYWORD`.

* The `c/` prefix checks whether an item is completed. For example, `c/completed` will check for the items that are completed.

* When `c/` is not specified, both complete and incomplete items will be shown.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects that have been completed.

1. Key in the command `find c/completed` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Completion Step 1](images/FindByCompletion1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Completion Step 2](images/FindByCompletion2.png)

3. All projects that are completed will be shown.

    ![Find by Completion Step 3](images/FindByCompletion3.png)

##### 5.1.7e. Searching by Multiple Parameters

You can search for items with multiple parameters for names, descriptions and tags in a single search.

To do this, you can add all the parameters that you would like to search for in the command. For example, if you would like to search for items that contain either `discussion` or `drawing` in their description, you can do so by searching using the command `find d/discussion drawing`.

In this command, each parameter to search for is separated by a whitespace.

The following walkthrough shows you can use the find command to search for projects with `discussion` or `drawing` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find d/discussion drawing` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 1](images/FindByMultipleKeywords1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 2](images/FindByMultipleKeywords2.png)

3. All projects that contain `discussion` or `drawing` in their description will be shown.

    ![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 3](images/FindByMultipleKeywords3.png)

You can use the same method to search for projects using multiple parameters for name or tags. However, this will not work with completion status. You can only search by one completion status. 

##### 5.1.7f. Searching by Multiple Prefixes

So far, you have learnt how to search for items that contain multiple parameters for a single prefix. But what if you want to search for items by multiple prefixes instead? 

Momentum makes it extremely easy for you to do that. 

To make such a search, all you need to do is add all the prefixes you would like to search for in a single find command. You can think of this as combining mulitple find commands together. For example, if you would like to search for items that contain either `certification` in their name or `discussion` in their description, you can do so by searching using the command `find n/certification d/discussion`.

The following walkthrough shows you can use the find command to search for projects that contain either `certification` in their name or `discussion` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find n/certification d/discussion` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Find by Multiple Prefixes Step 1](images/FindByMultipleParameters1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Find by Multiple Prefixes Step 2](images/FindByMultipleParameters2.png)

3. All projects that contain `certification` in their name or `discussion` in their description will be shown.

    ![Find by Multiple Prefixes Step 3](images/FindByMultipleParameters3.png)

You can also use multiple parameters for each prefix that allows for it as mentioned in the previous section. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: If a certain search prefix is used more than once, the last entry will be used.
`find n/a n/b n/c` will only search for items that contain`c` in their name.

</div>

##### 5.1.7g. Adding Match Type to Searches

So far, you have learnt how to make searches by multiple parameters and prefixes. However, the searches shown so far show an item as long as there is any one parameter that matches it. But this might not be useful in some cases. What if you need to search for an item that matches all parameters, or does not match any of the parameters entered.

This is where match type comes in. Match type can be added to your find command in addition to the prefixes and parameters you are searching by. 

There are three values for the `match/` prefix.
  * `match/all` shows an item only if **all** of the parameters and prefixes provided in your input matches the item.

  * `match/any` shows an item as long as **any** of the parameters and prefixes provided in your input matches the item.

  * `match/none` shows an item only if **none** of the parameters and prefixes provided in your input matches the item.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
`match/any` will be used if the `match` type is not specified.

</div>

Here is an example to illustrate this concept more clearly. Consider the following command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm`. We will compare how different match types affect the results displayed for the same command.

Let's first look at `match/any`. This match type shows an item as long as any parameter matches your input. It is also the default behaviour of the find command. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/any`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/any` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Match Any Step 1](images/MatchAny1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Match Any Step 2](images/MatchAny2.png)

3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name or `discussion` in their description or the tag `artcomm` will be shown.

   ![Match Any Step 3](images/MatchAny3.png)

As seen in the example above, an item is shown as long as any one of the parameters matches it. 

Let's now look at `match/all`. This match type shows an entry only if all parameters matches your input. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/all`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/all` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![Match All Step 1](images/MatchAll1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

    ![Match All Step 2](images/MatchAll2.png)

3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name and `discussion` in their description and the tag `artcomm` will be shown.

    ![Match All Step 3](images/MatchAll3.png)

As seen in the example above, an item is only shown if all parameters matches it. 

Finally, let's look at `match/none`. This match type shows an item only if none of the parameters matches your input. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/none`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/none` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   ![Match None Step 1](images/MatchNone1.png)

2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully.

   ![Match None Step 2](images/MatchNone2.png)

3. All projects that do not contain `ad` in their name, `discussion` in their description and the tag `artcomm` will be shown.

   ![Match None Step 3](images/MatchNone3.png)

As seen in the example above, an item is only shown if none of the parameters matches it.

The possibilities of using match type to enhance your searches are limitless. Here are some examples where `match/all
` and `match/none` may come in handy.

1. If you have many items and want to find a specific one, you can use `match/all` to narrow down your search results.

2. If you have many items and want to find those that are not part of a certain category, you can use `match/none` to narrrow down your search results.

#### 5.1.8. View All Projects/Tasks: `list`

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

When you are viewing projects, this command shows you a list of all projects in Momentum.

When you are viewing a project's tasks, this command shows you a list of all the tasks for the project.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb:
Note that this command is different from the `home` command. When viewing a project's tasks, the `home` command will change the view to show you all the projects being tracked by Momentum. However, the `list` command will only show you all the tasks for the project.

</div>

Format: `list`

The following walkthrough shows how you can list projects in Momentum.

Suppose you had previously executed a [find command](#searching-for-items-find) and would like to see all your projects again.

![List1](images/List1.png)

1. Type `list` into the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![List2](images/List2.png)
    
2. The results box will display a message to indicate that all your projects are being displayed. 

    ![List3](images/List3.png)

3. You should see that all your projects are being displayed in the displayed list.

    ![List4](images/List4.png)

### 5.2. Time Tracking

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

You can track the time you spend working on a project or task by starting a timer when you start working, and then stopping the timer once you finish.

Momentum remembers each timer that you start/stop and uses this information to calculate statistics.

#### 5.2.1. Starting a Timer: `start`

Format: `start ID`

* Starts a timer for the item at the specified `ID`.

* Only 1 timer can be running for each item at any time.

* You can refer to [Index Term](#index-term) for more information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb:
You can run timers for more than one item concurrently, if you are multi-tasking.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb:
You can run timers for a project separately from its tasks. This allows you to track the time you spent on the project as a whole, as well as the time spent on each individual task.

</div>

Example: `start 2`

Result: Starts a timer for the second item in the displayed list.

#### 5.2.2. Stopping a Timer: `stop`

Format: `stop ID`

* Stops a running timer for the item at the specified `ID`.

* A timer can only be stopped if there is one already running.

* You can refer to [Index Term](#index-term) for more information.

Example: `stop 2`

Result: Stops the timer for the second item in the displayed list.

#### 5.2.3. Active Timers Panel

On the left side of the window is the Active Timers Panel. This is where Momentum shows you all the timers that are currently running.

![ActiveTimersUI](images/ActiveTimersUI.png)
Figure X: Location of the Active Timers Panel.

This panel will show you the name of the item, as well as when the timer was started.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the `start` and `stop` commands to track the time that you spend on a project.

Suppose that you are going to start working on the project `Alpharad Youtube Endcard`, which is the first item shown below:

![TimerExample1](images/TimerExample1.png)

You can perform time tracking with the following steps:

1. To start the timer, type `start 1` into the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![TimerExample2](images/TimerExample2.png)

2. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully started.

    ![TimerExample3](images/TimerExample3.png)

3. You should also see the project's name and start time in the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample4](images/TimerExample4.png)

   Now that the timer has been successfully started, you can proceed to do your work. You can also choose to close Momentum. The timer will continue to run even when Momentum is closed. Proceed to the next step when you are done with your work.

4. To stop the timer, type `stop 1` into the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![TimerExample5](images/TimerExample5.png)

5. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully stopped.

    ![TimerExample6](images/TimerExample6.png)

6. You should also see that the project has been removed from the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample7](images/TimerExample7.png)

8. The [statistics panel](#statistics) will also be updated to reflect the time that you have spent working on the project:

    ![TimerExample8](images/TimerExample8.png)

### 5.3. Reminders

Done by Cheong Ying Yi Clara

* A reminder will be shown in the reminder panel of the sidebar at the date and time you specified.

* Momentum will remove the reminder in the item after it is shown in the sidebar.

* If you missed a reminder, it will be greyed out in the item.

* You can refer to [Creating a Project](#creating-a-project-task-add) for more details on how you can add a reminder.

* Redo command only works if the previous command is `undo`.

</div>

### 5.6. Statistics

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Momentum uses the data collected from your [timers](#time-tracking) to calculate statistics. These statistics are automatically generated and updated whenever you make any changes to your items, such as when you start or stop a new timer. They can be seen in a panel on the left side of the window, as shown here:

![StatisticsUI1](images/StatsUI1.png)
Figure X: Location of the statistics panel

The order of the statistics displayed correspond to the items currently shown in the displayed list, and will automatically change when the items in the displayed list changes (such as when you [find specific items](#searching-for-items-find) or [sort the list of items](#sort-projects-sort)).

![StatisticsUI2](images/StatsUI2.png)
Figure X: The order of the statistics entries matches the order in the displayed list.

You do not need to use any additional commands to update or view the statistics.

#### 5.6.1 Timeframes

Momentum only tracks your statistics within a particular timeframe. You can change the timeframe through the [settings](#settings).

Momentum allows you to track the time spent within these timeframes:

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly

By default, the timeframe will be set to weekly.

Here are the statistics being tracked by Momentum:

#### 5.6.2. Time Spent per Project/Task

This statistic tells you the total amount of time you have spent within the timeframe. For projects, this includes all the time you have spent on each individual task, as well as on the project as a whole.

![StatsUISplit](images/StatsUISplit.png)
Figure X: Sections of the statistics panel.

The statistics are displayed in 2 different formats:

1. **Pie Chart**: Shows the relative time spent on each item. Useful for comparing different items. Items with less time spent on them may not be shown.

2. **Table**: Shows the exact (in minutes) amount of time spent on each item. Useful for calculations.

### 5.7. Settings

Done by Khoo De Hui

Momentum allows you to change various settings so that you can make the application more suited to your preferences. Currently, the settings which you can adjust are:
* The application [theme](#user-interface-theme).
